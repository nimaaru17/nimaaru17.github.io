      <p><a href="https://healthynibblesandbits.com/paneer-tikka-masala/"target="_blank">Paneer Tikka Masala</a> is a North Indian dish made from marinated Paneer, which is India cottage cheese, that is pan-fried or grilled, then simmered in a rich, creamy tomato gravy. The paneer is sliced into smaller cubes and then coated with yogurt and spices, giving them a smoky, tangy flavor. The gravy is also rich with flavors of tomato, garlic, and ginger, making the dish both spicy and comforting at the same time. It is typically eaten with rice or naan (Indian Flatbread). This dish is often made in Indian restaurants and households during festivals and other special occasions.</p>
